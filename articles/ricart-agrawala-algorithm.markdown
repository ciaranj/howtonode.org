Title: Ricart & Agrawala's Mutual Exclusion Protocol
Author: Tim Caswell
Date:

From wikipedia:

> The **Ricart-Agrawala Algorithm** is an algorithm for
> mutual exclusion on a distributed system. This algorithm is
> an extension and optimization of
> [Lamport's Distributed Mutual Exclusion Algorithm][], by removing
> the need for *release* messages. It was developed by
> Glenn Ricart and Ashok Agrawala.

In this article we'll implement this article in node as an exercise in distributed socket based programming.
